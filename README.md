# tourist-info-system
java console-based (university assignment)

Implement a console-based tourist information system providing
information about tourist attractions in various cities. The administrator of the system will specify the
necessary information and tourists will view the information by choosing from a text-based menu. A search
feature is not required by this system.
Before implementing the system, do an analysis to identify all the necessary data members and member
functions required by each class, taking into consideration special functions like constructors and copy
constructors. Add more classes if needed to make it a comprehensive tourist information system, for
example, for new types of attractions.
